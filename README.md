# leaflet-challenge

This project uses USGS GeoJSON data to visualize a set of all earthquakes registering at a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the Richter scale, and occurring in the last seven days.

I used Leaflet to map the earthquakes, and added a bit of interactivity to explore the map.

The dataset used can be found here: (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)
